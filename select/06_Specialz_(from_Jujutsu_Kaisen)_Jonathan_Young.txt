You are my special
We’re dancing on the edge of a moment into Tokyo
The capital of the front lines
Let’s struggle on the very edge of death, and then you got to show
Us all we know that you’re impolite
I love you baby
So let’s keep on singing out
And though you’re outlandish
And maybe you’re foolish
Each move you’re making
Is burning my heart out
And if I run i will lose control
(You are my special)
Can’t you make me crazy, you’re driving me mad
I'll consume, I will eat everything to the fullest
Rendezvous in a lifelong maze that we had
I’m dizzy in this labyrinth
(You are my special)
We'll be spinning freely
Shouldn't we glow
So tell me why are you so clear in the head?
Rendezvous in a lifelong maze that we had
Don't care what anybody says
(You are my special)
We're special
(You are my special)
Let’s endure it on the edge of the ring, when is dark and stormy
On Tokyo’s lines rain is coming down
The press is running wild getting naked getting hurt and bloody
Don’t look down, don’t stay calm, that is not allowed
Get lost in me but you just defend yourself
How long are you gonna keep telling yourself that
Get lost in me, I can't believe
Regret my whole life and I'm done with that
Answer me
I want to feel your body heat
Blue light
Lit up by my frostbite
Don’t fool yourself romantically
Need you to cut to the chase with me
Can’t get drunk on love songs anymore
I love you baby
I love you baby
We’re dancing on the edge of a moment into Tokyo
The capital of the front lines
Plant your feet upon the edge of life
We don't have to be nice
I know that you're impolite
(You are my special)
Can’t you make me crazy, you’re driving me mad
I'll consume, I will eat everything to the fullest
Rendezvous in a lifelong maze that we had
I’m dizzy in this labyrinth
(You are my special)
We'll be spinning freely
Shouldn't we glow
So tell me why are you so clear in the head?
Rendezvous in the lifelong maze that we had
Don't care what anybody says
(You are my special)
We're special
Promise me you won’t stay calm
We're special
We are just what we are
We're special
Yeah we are special till the end
We're special
Don’t care what anybody says
(You are my special)
