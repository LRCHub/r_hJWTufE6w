[00:00.48] You are my special
[00:08.75] You are my special
[00:16.65] You are my special
[00:25.65] 
[00:18.27] Come on, let's dance to the edge and tumble down again
[00:22.62] Tokyo stands tall, post up at the end
[00:26.61] Let's struggle on to the edge of death 'til nothing is left
[00:30.81] Dance wildly, the bold are those who claim their respect
[00:58.81] 
[00:35.25] I love you, baby
[00:37.77] Sing again 'til the morning comes
[00:39.33] No matter your sorry state
[00:41.72] The childish game you play
[00:43.53] You burn through to my heart, let me cherish you always
[00:47.71] Don't ever run 'cause you know too well
[00:49.77] You are my special
[00:58.77] 
[00:51.52] Drive my heart in two, I feel it beating anew
[00:55.53] Put you under the spell, consume the future as well
[00:59.33] In that maze of you, we rendezvous
[01:03.78] A daze that I never felt, you are my special
[01:25.78] 
[01:07.55] Dancing to your tune, the whole world spins out of hue
[01:11.79] No, no, no, don't relax, the demon's breaking its shell
[01:16.14] In that maze of you, we rendezvous
[01:19.80] No matter what they may tell, you are my special
[01:24.17] We're special
[01:32.68] You are my special
[01:41.68] 
[01:34.08] Come on, let's brace for the edge before the moment ends
[01:38.60] Tokyo endures through the stormy winds
[01:42.33] Chased through a maze beat and bludgeoning a sorrowful set
[01:46.67] Don't wait, you'll repent by running wild, my friend
[02:12.67] 
[01:50.86] Get lost in me
[01:52.66] I'm only defending
[01:54.31] I wonder where the lies lead, if it were me, I'd scream in agony
[01:58.54] Get lost in me
[02:00.92] I can't believe it
[02:02.77] I've hated my life, where it leads and who I'll be
[02:27.77] 
[02:06.71] Come and show me, 'cause I can feel the fire growing
[02:10.85] Cold, feeling frozen, no, it's pain that (I'm holding)
[02:15.58] It's all been lies, it was a facade
[02:17.63] Your suffering was overflowing
[02:19.99] Now every old lover's songs deaf to me, so sing them on your own
[02:51.99] 
[02:24.15] I love you, baby
[02:32.36] I love you, baby
[02:40.36] 
[02:40.01] Come on, let's dance to the edge and tumble down again
[02:44.58] Tokyo stands tall, post up at the end
[02:48.27] Let's struggle on to the edge of death 'til nothing is left
[02:52.59] Dance straight to the end, you are my special
[03:15.09] 
[02:56.01] Drive my heart in two, I feel it beating anew
[03:00.40] Put you under the spell, consume the future as well
[03:04.62] In that maze of you, we rendezvous
[03:08.89] A daze that I never felt, you are my special
[03:30.89] 
[03:12.56] Dancing to your tune, the whole world spins out of hue
[03:16.82] No, no, no, don't relax, the demon's breaking its shell
[03:21.13] In that maze of you, we rendezvous
[03:25.15] No matter what they may tell, you are my special
[03:29.50] We're special
[03:36.00] 
[03:31.51] Demon's breaking out of its shell (we're special)
[03:35.24] You're just that kind of person as well (we're special)
[03:39.51] I've never seen in anyone else (we're special)
[03:43.95] No matter what they may tell you, you are my special
